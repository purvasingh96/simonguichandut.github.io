Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/">McGill Physics Department</a> and <a href="https://msi.mcgill.ca/">McGill Space Institute</a>. I work on the modeling of thermonuclear bursts on accreting compact objects, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/">Prof. Andrew Cumming</a>. My research combines aspects of nuclear astrophysics, fluid dynamics and computational physics. Before this, I completed an engineering physics degree at <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/phys/en/">Polytechnique Montréal</a>.

Outside of my research work, I am involved in the outreach efforts of the department. I am the current coordinator for <a href="https://msi.mcgill.ca/index.php?page=about-astromcgill">AstroMcGill</a>, a student-led group that organizes free public events for the promotion of science.

Otherwise, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/sguichandut">chess</a> and biking around Montréal.

The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:simon.guichandut@mcgill.ca">simon.guichandut@mail.mcgill.ca</a>.
