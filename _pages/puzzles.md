I plan to use this page to discuss my puzzle collection, record my best solve times, and talk about other miscellanious puzzle things.

Some years ago, I wrote a [Rubik's Cube 3x3 Beginner's guide](/assets/pdf/Rubiks_Cube_Guide.pdf){:target="\_blank"}, if anyone is interested in learning how to solve this famous puzzle. I lost the original LaTeX file, so apologies for any grammar mistakes.
