Type I X-ray bursts are the result of rapid nuclear burning of hydrogen, helium or carbon at the surface of an accreting neutron star. Often, the luminosity produced in 
the burst is so high that it reaches the Eddington limit, causing an outward expansion of the stellar surface against gravity. These bursts called photospheric radius expansion (PRE) 
bursts are observed by X-ray telescopes as a rapid drop of the star's temperature as its effective area increases.  By studying these PRE bursts, we can learn about 

Nucleosynthesis: the environment in which the nuclear burning takes place in these bursts is unique due to the presence of a large amount of free protons. Via the rp-process,
several high-Z nuclei may be produced in a short amount of time. Some fraction of these may be ejected by the super-Eddington wind, as supported by mounting evidence of spectral lines
during the PRE phase.
