Type I X-ray bursts are the result of rapid nuclear burning of hydrogen, helium or carbon at the surface of an accreting neutron star. Often, the luminosity produced in 
the burst is so high that it reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity">Eddington limit</a>, causing an outward expansion of the stellar surface against gravity. This expansion is driven by a super-Eddington wind, which accelerates gas particles to 1% of the speed of light. These bursts, called photospheric radius expansion (PRE) 
bursts, are observed by X-ray telescopes as a rapid drop of the star's temperature as its effective area increases.  

By studying PRE bursts, we may learn about 

- **Nucleosynthesis**: the environment in which the nuclear burning takes place is unique due to the presence of a large amount of free protons. Via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rp-process">rp-process</a>, several high-Z nuclei may be produced in a short amount of time. Some fraction of these may be ejected by the super-Eddington wind during the expansion phase.

- **Dense matter physics**: PRE bursts are one of the ways in which we can infer the mass and the radii of neutron stars. These parameters can in turn be used to determine the equation of state of matter at very high densities (how "squishy" it is). Neutron stars are the laboratories we need to obtain this key piece of physics, as such extreme conditions can never be created on earth. 

- **Fluid dynamics**: the winds produced in these bursts set themselves appart in many ways. Firstly, they are driven by radiation pressure (momentum carried by the enormous flux of photons), rather than thermal pressure. Secondly, they are launched at the surface of a compact star, which means Einstein's general relativity is crucial in describing their motion. Finally, the star can spin as fast as a kitchen blender, and have magnetic fields a trillion time stronger than earth's. For all of these reasons and others, the complicated dynamics of fluids in this scenario are an interesting aspect of study in their own right.

    Schematic showing the different scenarios of expansion in PRE bursts. At luminosities close to but smaller than the Eddington luminosity (<i>left</i>), the atmosphere expands against gravity but remains in hydrostatic balance. Above the Eddington luminosity (<i>right</i>), a wind ejects gas from the star at a high velocity and increases its apparent radius by a factor of up to 100.
